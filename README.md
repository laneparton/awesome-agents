## What Makes a Good Example

This repository focuses on **problem-first** examples. Each submission should clearly articulate:

- **The specific pain point** - What was the manual process? How long did it take? What made it frustrating?
- **Measurable impact** - Time saved, accuracy improved, cost reduced
- **Real-world validation** - Must link to original source (tweet, blog, video, GitHub)
- **Practical lessons** - What made the solution work? What challenges were overcome?

We're not interested in theoretical use cases or marketing content. Every example must be grounded in actual implementation.
