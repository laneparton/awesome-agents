# Contributing to Awesome Agent Examples

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This repository showcases real-world AI agent implementations with a focus on the problems they solve.

## What Makes a Good Submission

### Required Elements

Every example must include:

1. **A Specific Problem**
   - What was the manual process before the agent?
   - How long did it take?
   - What made it frustrating, error-prone, or inefficient?
   - Include scale: "processing 20-50 deals per project" not just "processing deals"

2. **A Clear Solution**
   - What does the agent do?
   - What's the measurable outcome (time saved, accuracy gained, cost reduced)?
   - How does it actually work (key technologies, approach)?

3. **Original Source**
   - Must link to the original source (tweet, blog post, video, GitHub repo)
   - Credit the original author/creator
   - If you're submitting your own work, that's great! Just provide the link

4. **Practical Lessons**
   - What made this solution work well?
   - Were there any challenges or iterations?
   - Any technical insights worth sharing?

### Quality Guidelines

**We Accept:**
- Real implementations with verified sources
- Both successes and instructive failures (if lessons are clear)
- Examples from individuals, companies, and researchers
- Solutions using any tools/frameworks (no vendor bias)

**We Don't Accept:**
- Theoretical or hypothetical use cases
- Marketing content or promotional material
- Examples without credible sources
- Vague descriptions without specifics
- Duplicates of existing examples

## Submission Process

### Option 1: Submit via Issue (Easiest)

1. Click on [Issues](../../issues)

3. Fill out all required fields
4. Submit the issue

We'll review your submission and create the example file if approved.

### Option 2: Submit via Pull Request

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b add-example-name`)
3. Create your example file in the appropriate category folder (`examples/category/your-example.md`)
4. Follow the [example template](#example-template) below
5. Update the main README.md to add your example to the category section
6. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add: [Example Name]'`)

8. Open a Pull Request

### Example Template

Create a new `.md` file in the appropriate category folder using this structure:

```markdown
# [Example Name]

**Author**: [Name/Handle]
**Source**: [Link to original tweet/blog/video/repo]
**Date**: [Month Year]
**Tags**: `tag1` `tag2` `tag3`

## The Problem

[3-5 sentences describing the specific pain point. Include:
- What was the manual process?
- How long did it take?
- What made it frustrating/error-prone?
- Scale of the problem (e.g., "20-50 deals per project")]

## The Solution

[2-3 sentences on what the agent does and the outcome]

**Impact**: [Quantify the improvement - time saved, accuracy gained, etc.]

## How It Works

[Bullet points on the key components/approach:
- Tool/technology used
- Process flow
- Any clever techniques or integrations]

## Key Insight

[1-2 sentences on what made this work well or lessons learned]

## Links

- [Original Source](url)
- [Video Demo](url) (if available)
- [Code/GitHub](url) (if available)
```

## Category Guidelines

Choose the most appropriate category for your example:

- **üíº Finance & Investment** - Trading, analysis, portfolio management, financial research
- **üìß Productivity & Automation** - Workflow automation, email management, scheduling, task management
- **üõ†Ô∏è Development & Engineering** - Code generation, testing, documentation, DevOps
- **üî¨ Research & Analysis** - Academic research, data gathering, literature reviews, analysis
- **‚úçÔ∏è Content Creation** - Writing, editing, social media, marketing content
- **üìä Data Analysis** - Data processing, visualization, reporting, insights generation

If your example spans multiple categories, choose the primary one and mention the others in tags.

## Writing Style

- **Problem-first framing** - Always lead with the pain point
- **Concrete and specific** - Use numbers, timelines, real scenarios
- **Educational** - Highlight what made the solution work
- **Neutral tone** - Stick to facts, avoid promotional language
- **Proper attribution** - Always credit original authors/creators
