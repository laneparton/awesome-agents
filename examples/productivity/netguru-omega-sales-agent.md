# Omega - AI Sales Agent

## The Problem

Sales representatives at Netguru spent significant time on routine administrative tasks: preparing call agendas, summarizing conversations, organizing project documentation, generating proposal feature lists, and tracking deal momentum across multiple disconnected systems (Slack, HubSpot, Salesforce, Google Drive, Apollo). This context-switching reduced time available for actual selling and relationship building.

**The Manual Process:**
- Manually prepare agendas before sales calls by reviewing multiple documents
- Take notes during conversations and manually create summaries
- Search across Google Drive, CRM, and other tools for relevant project details
- Manually compile proposal feature lists from various sources
- Track deal progress by checking multiple platforms
- Switch between Slack, HubSpot, Salesforce, Drive to complete tasks
- Ensure alignment with company sales framework across all activities

**Key Pain Points:**
- Routine tasks consume time that could be spent selling
- Context-switching between multiple tools reduces efficiency
- Manual documentation and summarization prone to inconsistency
- Difficult to maintain alignment with sales framework across reps
- Information scattered across disconnected systems
- Repetitive administrative work reduces sales productivity

## The Solution

Omega is a multi-agent AI system integrated into Slack that automates sales workflows by preparing call agendas, summarizing conversations, navigating project documentation, generating proposals, and tracking deal momentum—all without leaving Slack. The system uses three specialized agents that analyze, execute, and review tasks.

**Impact**: Automated routine sales tasks across multiple workflow stages, eliminating context-switching and allowing sales reps to focus on high-value selling activities directly within Slack.

## How It Works

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration** - SalesAgent analyzes requests and determines next steps; PrimaryAgent executes tasks; CriticAgent reviews outcomes
- **Sales Framework Alignment** - SalesAgent ensures all activities align with Netguru's sales methodology
- **Unified Tool Integration** - Connects Slack, HubSpot, Salesforce, Google Drive, and Apollo in single workflow
- **Expert Call Preparation** - Generates agendas by analyzing relevant documents and deal context
- **Conversation Intelligence** - Summarizes sales calls and extracts action items
- **Proposal Automation** - Generates feature lists by navigating project documentation
- **Deal Momentum Tracking** - Monitors progress across CRM and communication channels

**Process Flow:**
1. Sales rep submits request in Slack (e.g., "Prepare agenda for tomorrow's call with Client X")
2. **SalesAgent** receives request and analyzes based on Netguru sales framework
3. SalesAgent determines next best step and required data sources
4. **PrimaryAgent** executes the task:
   - Retrieves relevant documents from Google Drive
   - Pulls deal context from HubSpot/Salesforce
   - Accesses conversation history from Slack
   - Compiles information following sales framework
5. **CriticAgent** reviews the output and provides feedback
6. If feedback indicates issues, PrimaryAgent refines; otherwise proceeds
7. Final output delivered to sales rep in Slack with actionable insights
8. Rep can request refinements or proceed with prepared materials

**Technical Architecture:** Serverless cloud-native infrastructure built on AWS Lambda for scalability with minimal overhead. Three specialized LLM-powered agents collaborate: SalesAgent for analysis and framework alignment, PrimaryAgent for task execution and integration orchestration, CriticAgent for quality review and feedback. Integrations with Slack, HubSpot, Salesforce, Google Drive, and Apollo enable unified data access.

**Development Evolution:** Started as a basic Slack bot that fetched project files and links. Progressively evolved based on sales team usage patterns, adding intelligence, integrations, and multi-agent specialization to handle increasingly complex workflows.

## Key Insight

**Iterative evolution from simple bot to multi-agent system based on real usage.** Rather than over-engineering the initial version, Netguru started with a basic Slack file-fetching bot and progressively added capabilities as sales teams' needs became clear.

**Why This Matters:**
- Starting simple (file fetching bot) validated the Slack-native approach before heavy investment
- Real usage patterns informed which capabilities to build next
- Multi-agent architecture emerged from complexity needs, not upfront design
- Sales framework integration ensures consistency across all reps and deals
- Critic-agent pattern provides quality control and continuous improvement
- Serverless architecture (AWS Lambda) enables scalability without infrastructure overhead

**Multi-Agent Pattern**: The analyze-execute-review pattern (SalesAgent → PrimaryAgent → CriticAgent) provides built-in quality control while maintaining alignment with company methodology, a key requirement for enterprise sales workflows.

**Integration Strategy**: Unifying disparate tools (Slack, HubSpot, Salesforce, Drive, Apollo) within Slack eliminates context-switching while preserving existing tool investments—critical for adoption in established sales organizations.
