# Dropbox AI-Powered File Summaries and Q&A

**Domain**: Productivity & Automation

## Problem

Knowledge workers face significant information overload when managing large documents and video files. Users need to:
- Manually read through lengthy documents to extract key information
- Watch entire videos to find specific content
- Context-switch between multiple files to answer questions
- Spend excessive time on routine information retrieval tasks

This manual approach is time-consuming and creates friction in daily workflows, particularly for teams collaborating on shared content in Dropbox.

## Solution

Dropbox implemented an AI-powered system that provides instant summaries and answers questions about file content directly in file previews on the web. The system leverages two complementary approaches:

### File Summaries
- **Riviera Conversion Framework**: Converts diverse file formats (documents, videos, etc.) into embeddings
- **K-means Clustering**: Selects dissimilar chunks across the document to capture diverse content
- **LLM Synthesis**: Generates comprehensive summaries from selected representative chunks

### Q&A System
- **Embedding-based Semantic Search**: Retrieves chunks semantically similar to user queries
- **Context-aware Responses**: LLM generates answers grounded in retrieved content
- **Real-time Interaction**: Immediate responses without reading entire documents

## Impact

### Cost Efficiency
- **93% cost reduction** for file summaries
- **64% cost reduction** for Q&A queries

### Performance Improvements
- **96.5% latency improvement** for summaries: 115s → 4s (P75)
- **80% latency improvement** for Q&A: 25s → 5s (P75)

### Production Deployment
- Available in early access on select Dropbox plans
- Seamlessly integrated into web file preview experience
- Handles diverse file formats (documents, videos, presentations)

## Key Insights

### 1. Opposing Retrieval Strategies for Different Use Cases
The team discovered that summarization and Q&A require fundamentally different chunk selection strategies:
- **Summaries**: K-means clustering selects *dissimilar* chunks to capture document breadth
- **Q&A**: Semantic search selects *similar* chunks to query for specific answers
- This dual approach optimizes both breadth of understanding and precision of responses

### 2. Format-Agnostic Processing with Riviera
The Riviera framework provides a unified conversion pipeline:
- Handles text documents, videos, and other formats through a single interface
- Generates LLM-compatible embeddings regardless of source format
- Enables consistent AI experiences across diverse content types

### 3. Production-Grade Performance Optimization
Significant cost and latency improvements achieved through:
- Efficient chunk selection reducing LLM token consumption
- Optimized embedding generation and retrieval pipelines
- Strategic caching and processing optimizations
